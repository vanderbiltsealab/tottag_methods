# tottag_methods
Data and analysis scripts for the introductory TotTag study.

This repository includes:
1. Processed .log files produced over two days of recording each from two families: a family of four (Family One: 30-month-old son, 61-month-old daughter, 37-year-old father, 37-year-old mother), and a family of three (Family Two; 12-month-old daughter, 35-year-old-father, 33-year-old mother). These were produced using the processing scripts available at https://github.com/lab11/totternary/tree/master/software/analysis
2. Summary .csv files containing data about the language environment from LENA DLPs worn by the children over the two days of recording. These files were produced using the LENA ADEX software.
3. The R markdown file used to produce the results presented in 10.31234/osf.io/h2fy6
